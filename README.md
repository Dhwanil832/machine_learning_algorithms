# Machine Learning Programs
This repository contains basic machine learning programs that I have developed as part of my studies. These programs are written in Python and can be used for educational purposes or as a starting point for more complex projects.

# Programs included
The following machine learning programs are included in this repository:

  1.Linear Regression
  
  2.Multiclass Linear Regression
  
  3.Logistic Regression
  
  4.k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
  
  5.Naive Bayes Classifier
  
  6.Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  
  7.Decision Tree
  
  8.Principle Component Analysis
  
  9.Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  
  10.K-Means Clustering
  
Each program is contained in its own Python file and can be run independently.

# Requirements
The following packages are required to run the machine learning programs:

  NumPy

  Pandas

  Scikit-learn
